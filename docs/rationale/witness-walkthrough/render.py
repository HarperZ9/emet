"""Regenerate the EMET *witness* walkthrough transcript, deterministically.

This is the companion render to walkthrough/render.py. Where that one traces a
single artifact through the membrane commands, this one demonstrates the WITNESS
arc end to end, in three real captures the essay annotates:

  (1) THE STRUCTURAL GATE - run the repo Python so that it imports `verdict` and
      calls governed(LATTICE, "TRUSTED"): it RAISES VerdictError at construction
      time, inside the TCB, before a byte reaches stdout (Boundary 1 is
      structural, not a review rule). Then governed(REVERT, "REVERTIBLE")
      returns the token VERBATIM - the gate guards WHAT, never alters bytes.

  (2) THE INDEPENDENT WITNESS - run `python test_organs.py` from the repo root.
      The RUN, not a review, confirms the organs report the re-derivable FACT
      (REVERTIBLE / NOT_REVERTIBLE), the ALLOW/BLOCK permission words gone.

  (3) ONE WITNESS THRICE - run the language-agnostic conformance runner against
      the Python reference (membrane.py) and the Node port (impl/js/emet.js).
      Both print CONFORMANCE 19/19. They AGREE - and they share an author, so
      the agreement shows the spec is implementable, not yet independently
      re-derivable (SPEC s.12). The annotation in the essay is the load-bearing
      part: same-author agreement is not an independent witness.

Determinism: each capture is a function of fixed repo bytes plus the stdlib, so
same `verdict.py` / `organs.py` / `membrane.py` / `emet.js` + same vectors ->
byte-identical transcript. The only volatile field is an absolute temp path the
structural-gate snippet runs from; it is normalized to <SANDBOX>. `--check`
asserts the committed transcript still matches a fresh render (CI drift-guard).

Stdlib only. No third-party imports. Like walkthrough/render.py.
