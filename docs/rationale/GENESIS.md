EMET did not begin as an integrity verifier. It began as a **coherence membrane**
for debugging a Direct3D 11 renderer -- and the line from that origin to this
closed-lattice, no-`TRUSTED` tool is short and exact. This document records it,
because a tool whose whole credential is re-derivation should be able to
re-derive its own ancestry too.

## 1. The problem it was born to solve

The membrane was first articulated in **RAW** (a D3D11 rendering platform), in two
documents: `COHERENCE_MEMBRANE.md` and `DOCTRINE.md`. Both name one problem with
precision: an LLM building a renderer has **no simulator underneath it** -- no
symbol table of live bindings, no heap of actual values, no execution cursor. So
when it asserts *"SSGI samples the HiZ pyramid at `t27`,"* that is, in the genesis
doc's own words, *"a guess about runtime state dressed as a fact."* Worse,
*"confidence does not fall when accuracy does -- confident-but-wrong about a
binding or a race is the default failure, and the most expensive kind."*

The doctrine's response was a single law:

> *"Observe inputs → reason locally → measure outputs. Never assert runtime state
> from the code in your head -- instrument it."* (RAW `DOCTRINE.md`)

That is the seed of everything EMET is. The membrane was the **oracle layer** that
made the law enforceable: *"interpreter of ground truth, not source … the proxy
reports, the host adjudicates … a claim the model cannot ground against an emitted
artifact is a claim it must label 'unknown,' not assert."* (RAW
`COHERENCE_MEMBRANE.md`)

## 2. The doctrine EMET kept (the mapping)

Strip the graphics and the runtime, and the genesis doctrine *is* EMET's six
boundaries. The mapping is **load-bearing** -- these are not analogies, they are the
same commitments re-expressed:

| Genesis doctrine (RAW, 2026-06-05) | EMET design element |
|---|---|
| "interpreter of ground truth, not source" | trust by **re-derivation**, never authority (SPEC §6.5, §8) |
| three legitimacy properties: **externalized · witnessed-not-inferred · independently-checkable** | re-derivable output · the **witness** ([09](./09-witnesses.md)) · the **external check of record** ([05](./05-authored-root.md), SPEC §11) |
| "a claim it cannot ground → label *unknown*, not assert" | **`UNVERIFIABLE`, never `TRUSTED`** (SPEC §2, §9) |
| "the proxy reports, the host adjudicates … advisory" | **facts, not authority**; advisory by default ([01](./01-is-ought-seam.md), SPEC §6.1, §6.4) |
| "the operator is the perceiver of last resort" / single actuator | **zero actuation; the operator is the single actuator** ([04](./04-spoken-for.md), SPEC §6.6) |
| "an unverified membrane is net-negative -- it **launders falsehood with ground-truth authority**" | EMET **cannot be its own root of trust**; selftest asserts no authority ([05](./05-authored-root.md), SPEC §11) |
| **read-gate** (nothing enters as fact unless witnessed) | `verify` / `coherence` / `corroborate` -- the byte-witness path |
| **write-gate** (nothing leaves as effect unless witnessed) -- *named as the missing organ* | the actuation boundary EMET holds by **refusing to act at all** (the operator owns the write) |
| host selftests gate every oracle (`bindings.py` 8/8, `raw_eyes.py` 12/12) | `selftest` + the conformance suite (19 vectors) |
| "convert confident-but-wrong-in-head into a **checkable claim with a witness**" | the whole witness thesis ([09](./09-witnesses.md)–[14](./14-witness-walkthrough.md)) |

The genesis doc even pre-stated EMET's deepest reflexive result -- that you cannot
be your own witness -- in the form of its fifth honest limit: *an unverified
membrane launders falsehood with ground-truth authority*, which is exactly why
[05](./05-authored-root.md) says EMET must not be its own root and [09](./09-witnesses.md)
says self-agreement carries zero independent weight.

## 3. What EMET dropped, and what it generalized

EMET is **not** RAW, and the difference is the whole of its design (status:
load-bearing). What was dropped was everything *graphics- and runtime-specific*:
the D3D11 proxy, the binding ledger, the per-pass output metrics, the HiZ pyramid,
the frame capture -- the entire apparatus of instrumenting a live GPU. What was
kept and **generalized** was the doctrine: *witness ground truth, report facts not
authority, label the un-grounded `UNVERIFIABLE`, leave actuation to the operator,
and never be your own root.*

The move is a distillation from a **runtime oracle** (what the hardware *actually
did* this frame) to a **byte-and-provenance oracle** (do these exact bytes
re-derive the hash an operator pinned?). RAW's membrane answered "what is bound at
`t27` right now"; EMET's answers "is this artifact what it was when you authorized
it." Same membrane, one rung more abstract -- and language-agnostic, so a second
author can re-derive it (the bar RAW's host-selftests gestured at and EMET's §12
names exactly).

## 4. QUANTA-UNIVERSE -- the membrane across the ecosystem

The membrane was not a one-project idea. **QUANTA-UNIVERSE** is the grand
integration exemplar of `quantalang` (`01-full_universe.quanta`) -- a language whose
ecosystem carries the same operator's vocabulary (an `oracle` layer, a `photon`
rendering layer echoing RAW). It is recorded here as **lineage / illumination**,
not as a load-bearing source: it shows the membrane doctrine was applied as a
*method* across the operator's work, of which EMET is the part that distilled the
method into a standalone, externally-anchored verifier. (Confidence on the
membrane↔quantalang connection: moderate -- a shared vocabulary and author, cited
as lineage, not a derivation EMET leans on.)

## 5. The provenance pin (the membrane witnessing its own origin)

On **2026-06-08**, EMET was pointed at its own genesis -- `anchor` then `verify` --
and re-derived all three documents `MATCH`:

```text
$ python membrane.py anchor  COHERENCE_MEMBRANE.md  DOCTRINE.md  01-full_universe.quanta
$ python membrane.py verify  ...   ->   MATCH / MATCH / MATCH
```

| Genesis document | SHA-256 (anchored) |
|---|---|
| `raw/COHERENCE_MEMBRANE.md` | `e7f1b2d6038103ec8f549d7874e68fd0624486dd1ad79ecfb116758a7a61d9a9` |
| `raw/DOCTRINE.md` | `3ece260afdd494e119500a8b4515b9bc4a80b3dd2e4bee368556cc0c42a01301` |
| `quantalang…/samples/01-full_universe.quanta` | `1807ecea10be0885e266959f89ec3be683b2a00cd6a318b322a6dc814f588cd7` |

**An honest scoping of this pin.** Those three files live *outside* the public
EMET repository (they belong to separate projects), so a public reader cannot
re-hash them -- this is a provenance *commitment*, not a publicly-re-derivable one.
It is fully re-derivable by anyone holding the genesis files (the operator), which
is the correct scope: EMET pins the origin it can witness and declines to publish
bytes that are not its to publish. The pin is a date-stamped hash commitment to
*which* genesis the lineage above was distilled from; if those files later change,
re-anchoring will show `DRIFT`, and that is the feature.

## 6. The clean-room boundary (what is NOT incorporated)

RAW's own `LINEAGE.md` is scrupulous about IP, and EMET inherits that discipline
exactly. The genesis doctrine documents (`COHERENCE_MEMBRANE.md`, `DOCTRINE.md`)
are the operator's **clean-room original** work -- they describe RAW's *own* oracle
design and copy no third-party source. What RAW quarantines -- reverse-engineered
ENBSeries binaries, Bethesda `SkyrimSE.exe` / Ghidra disassembly, third-party
preset and forum archives -- is **not** part of this lineage and **never enters
EMET**. This document carries an *idea* (the membrane doctrine), re-stated in
EMET's words, with short attributed quotation of the operator's own doctrine; it
transplants no code and no proprietary material.

## Close

EMET's first line of code re-derives a hash and reports a fact. Its first
*ancestor* did the same for a GPU frame, and named the law that makes either one
honest: *instrument, don't assert; report the witnessed, label the unknown, leave
the acting to the operator.* That the tool can now `anchor` and `verify` the very
documents that taught it this -- same bytes, same answer, `MATCH` -- is the lineage
proving itself by the only credential the lineage ever accepted. The membrane was
born watching a renderer for confident-but-wrong claims. It grew up refusing to be
one.
