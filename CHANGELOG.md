## 1.2.0 - 2026-08-04 - DeepEval reporter ships in the wheel

The DeepEval reporter now installs with the package. Through 1.1.0 it lived in
`adapters/deepeval_reporter.py`, which was NOT in the wheel (`[tool.setuptools]
packages = ["emet"]`), so `pip install emet[deepeval]` did not actually give a
user the reporter file. It now ships and imports after a plain install. The spec
contract stays frozen at 1.0.0 (`spec_version` unchanged); this is a
distribution-and-packaging change, not a new capability.

Changed:

- **The reporter graduated to the shipped `emet.reporters` subpackage.**
  `adapters/deepeval_reporter.py` moved to `emet/reporters/deepeval.py`, so the
  public import is now `from emet.reporters.deepeval import mint_receipt,
  build_eval_record, evaluate_and_mint`. The wheel enumerates the subpackage
  explicitly (`packages = ["emet", "emet.reporters"]`); the old `sys.path` shim is
  gone (the reporter is importable in-package). The eval receipts it mints and the
  four `eval-receipt` conformance vectors are unchanged: they verify through `emet
  check`, independent of the reporter's import path.

- **The minimal-TCB boundary is preserved (SPEC section 10).** `emet.reporters` is
  a separate, clearly-labeled OUT-OF-CORE package, not part of the named core
  (membrane, organs, monitor, corpus, verdict, report). Core `dependencies` stay
  `[]`; DeepEval stays the optional `deepeval` extra, imported LAZILY inside the
  function that runs an evaluation; no core module imports the reporter; and the
  reporter is excluded from the selftest artifact-of-record (`membrane.CORE_SRC`,
  SPEC s.14), so the zero-dependency and self-hash guarantees are unchanged.
  `emet/reporters/__init__.py` has no side effects and imports nothing heavy.

- **Version bump to 1.2.0** across `pyproject.toml`, `emet/__init__.py`
  `__version__`, and `emet/report.py` `EMET_VERSION` (the `--json` envelope's
  `emet_version`). `SPEC_VERSION`/`spec_version` remain 1.0.0.

## 1.1.0 - 2026-07-07 - Portable witness receipts, cross-language parity, experimental rebind

Verdicts now travel: a receipt made on one machine re-derives on another, in
three of the four implementations, with zero shared state. The spec contract
stays frozen at 1.0.0 (`spec_version` is unchanged); this release adds
sections 17 and 18 as new capabilities on top of it. Rebind is EXPERIMENTAL.

Added:

- **Portable witness receipt** (SPEC section 17): `emet receipt --from-json
  <file|->` turns a `verify`/`anchor`/`coherence`/`corroborate --json` envelope
  into a self-contained, content-addressed JSON receipt that a DIFFERENT party
  re-derives and checks on their own machine with the new stateless verifier
  `emet check <receipt.json> [--recompute-from-paths]` - zero shared state, zero
  trust in the producer, zero network. This lifts the section 15 limit that the
  anchor store is implementation-private so a verdict could not leave the machine
  that made it. `receipt_id` content-addresses the receipt
  (`sha256(canonical(receipt minus receipt_id, signature, and witness))`, s.17.2);
  tampering any addressed field re-hashes to a different id. An optional HMAC-SHA256 `signature` keyed by
  `EMET_RECEIPT_SIGNING_KEY` adds integrity when producer and verifier share a
  key channel. The check emits the new closed `RECEIPT` lattice
  (`RECEIPT_VALID` -> exit 0, `RECEIPT_TAMPERED` -> 1, `RECEIPT_UNVERIFIABLE` ->
  2), which maps to no authority word. Core in `emet/witness_receipt.py`; optional
  offline re-verifier convenience wrapper in
  `adapters/witness_receipt_portable.py`.

- **Stripped-credential rebind** (SPEC section 18, EXPERIMENTAL): `emet rebind
  <naked> --manifest <m.json> [--claim <identity>]` re-establishes a MATCH on
  naked bytes whose embedded provenance was stripped (the C2PA failure mode). EMET
  never bound to embedded metadata: it anchors the sha256 of the raw bytes out of
  band, so rebind re-derives the naked bytes' content hash and rebinds it to a
  known anchor in a portable, content-addressed rebind manifest
  (`emet-rebind-manifest/v1`). Verdicts are the closed primary lattice: `MATCH`
  (rebound to a known anchor) -> exit 0, `DRIFT` (a claimed identity with
  substituted bytes, or right bytes under a wrong claimed name) -> 1,
  `UNVERIFIABLE` (no known anchor - the honest default - or a manifest whose
  `manifest_id` does not re-derive) -> 2. `MATCH` is a fact of re-derivation, never
  trust, and maps to no authority word. A rebind verdict seals into a witness
  receipt (section 17) unchanged, and rides the existing tamper-evident log. Build
  manifests with `emet rebind --build-manifest <path>=<identity> ...`. Core in
  `emet/rebind.py`; four `capability: "rebind"` conformance vectors; behavior tests
  in `test_rebind.py`. Cross-language (Rust/Node/Go) parity is SPECced as follow-on
  in `docs/REBIND-SPEC.md` and is NOT yet a required conformance capability.

- **Cross-language receipt parity (Rust + Node.js).** `receipt`/`check` are now
  ported to the Rust (`impl/rust/emet.rs`) and Node.js (`impl/js/emet.js`)
  implementations, so three of the four impls can emit and offline-verify a
  receipt. The content address (`receipt_id`) is **byte-identical across
  implementations** for the same subject/verdict/spec/issued_at. Rust composes
  HMAC-SHA256 over its own hand-rolled SHA-256 (no external crate; pinned to RFC
  4231) and Node.js uses the built-in `crypto`, so both verify signed receipts as
  well as unsigned ones. Five new conformance vectors (`receipt-valid`,
  `receipt-tampered-id-flip`, `receipt-tampered-signature`,
  `receipt-unverifiable-malformed`, `receipt-subject-drift`) lock the cross-impl
  behavior; the suite is now 40 vectors. The Go implementation passes the 35 core
  vectors and does not yet implement `receipt`/`check` (its 5 receipt vectors are
  skipped by capability via `EMET_SKIP_CAPABILITIES=receipt`), the remaining
  parity item.

Changed:

- **Receipt content address excludes the `witness` block (SPEC s.17.2).** The
  per-implementation `witness` (implementation name + that implementation's own
  artifact-of-record `self_sha256`) is producer identity, not a
  re-derivation-governed field; including it made `receipt_id` intrinsically
  per-implementation and would have broken the byte-identical-across-impls
  guarantee. The address is now `sha256(canonical(receipt minus receipt_id,
  signature, and witness))`; the witness block still travels as descriptive
  metadata. Surfaced while porting to Rust/Node.js (fix-the-spec).

- **Proof-surface bundle witness** in `adapters/proof_surface_receipt.py`: a new
  `bundle <bundle.json>` subcommand that re-derives a content-addressed
  `proof-surface-bundle/v0` manifest. For every `files[]` entry it recomputes the
  sha256 of the sibling file next to `bundle.json` and compares it to the recorded
  digest. It emits an EMET witness receipt in the existing receipt shape and keeps
  the closed lattice: `MATCH` when every file re-derives, `DRIFT` when a recorded
  digest no longer matches the file on disk, `UNVERIFIABLE` when a listed file is
  missing/unreadable or the manifest is malformed or off-schema. The witness runs
  entirely in EMET (it does not import proof-surface) and preserves the
  no-authority contract: an authority-shaped token anywhere in the manifest is
  refused and the verdict never becomes `TRUSTED`.

Docs:

- **Visual-identity refresh:** a spectrum banner (`.github/assets/banner.svg`)
  now heads the README, and the static version badge is replaced with a live
  PyPI downloads badge so the README never pins a stale version.
- **README overhaul:** rewritten feature-first (a current introduction, what
  the tool does before how it is built), while keeping the honest maturity
  language: the different-author re-derivability bar (SPEC section 12) is
  still open, and the delivery contract test now covers the new surface.

## 1.0.0 - 2026-06-30 - Frozen contract, four implementations

First tagged release. The spec is frozen at 1.0.0; the reference implementations
are production-grade. 1.0.0 asserts a stable contract and solid implementations -
NOT that re-derivability is independently proven (SPEC section 12's
different-author bar stays open; the call for it stands).

Breaking (no prior tagged release existed, so no installed base to migrate):

- **Exit-code split (SPEC s.5):** `0` held; `1` a negative finding (DRIFT,
  VIEW_DIFFERS_FROM_SOURCE, QUARANTINE_READ_PATH_DIVERGENCE, BROKEN); `2`
  UNVERIFIABLE; `3` markers; `64` usage. Previously DRIFT/UNVERIFIABLE/etc. all
  collapsed to `2`. verify uses a precedence rule (a difference dominates an
  inability to check). organs and monitor adopt the same semantic.
- **selftest token rename (SPEC s.14):** the canonical token is
  `emet_self_sha256=`; the legacy `membrane_self_sha256=` alias is still emitted
  through the 1.x window and removed at 2.0. The Python artifact-of-record is now
  the sorted concatenation of the core source files, not just `membrane.py`.

Added:

- **`--json` envelope (SPEC s.13):** a machine-readable canonical-JSON output mode
  (sorted keys, `", "`/`": "`, ensure_ascii) whose governed fields are
  byte-identical across implementations; the closed lattice holds in JSON too.
- **A fourth implementation, Go** (`impl/go/emet.go`, stdlib-only, clean-room from
  the spec), joining the Python reference, Rust, and Node.js. All four pass the
  same 35 conformance vectors in CI.
- **Packaging:** installable as `emet` with an `emet` console script,
  zero runtime dependencies; the run-from-checkout story is preserved.

Freeze hardening (SPEC): pinned the reason-code enum (s.9), the audit prev-linkage
check and UTF-8 canonical-hash encoding (s.7), the `.refused` replacement token
and filename (s.4), the absent-log genesis behavior (s.13), and a warning that
default JSON encoders do not produce the canonical form. New vectors enforce the
reason codes, the governed `spec_version`, and multi-path verify precedence.

An adversarial verification pass then pinned four more edge cases with vectors and
aligned all four implementations on them: a logged fact containing an astral
(surrogate-pair) character audits INTACT (s.7); an unparseable log line is BROKEN,
not UNVERIFIABLE (s.7); `verify` of an absent+unanchored path reports E_NO_ANCHOR
(anchor-relative, s.13); and `coherence` carries the failing leg as
`source:`/`view:` in its reason (s.13). It also corrected the docs to stop listing
`self_sha256` among the cross-impl byte-identical fields - it is a per-implementation
identity (s.14), never compared across implementations. 35 conformance vectors, all
four implementations.

## 2026-06-29 - EMET Forward Delivery Contract

- Added a root delivery regression test for README, usage, changelog, funding,
  authorship, contribution, license, CI, and visual asset coverage.
- Added README sections for public value, usage, and developer workflow.
- Added the `assets/emet-hero.svg` visual identity asset.
- Renamed credential-shaped illustrative variables in documentation examples.
- Added `public-surface-sweeper` as the local delivery verification gate.
- Preserved EMET's advisory-only witness boundary and closed verdict lattice.

## Current Status

- Visibility: public-facing advisory integrity witness.
- Runtime posture: stdlib-only external verifier; no enforcement, deployment,
  signing, or actuation.
- Verdict posture: closed lattice only: `MATCH`, `DRIFT`, `UNVERIFIABLE`.
