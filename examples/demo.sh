# Best-effort demo - not runtime-verified by author.

# Drives the real EMET surface end-to-end against a sample input. Uses only real
# membrane.py commands and the public marker corpus. Runs in a scratch directory
# so it writes no state into the repo (anchors.json / *_log.jsonl / *.refused are
# created inside $WORK and are .gitignored anyway).
#
# Usage:  sh examples/demo.sh
#
# Requires: python (3.x), and the membrane.py / corpus.py / verdict.py core.
