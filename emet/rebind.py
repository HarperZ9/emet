"""rebind.py - stripped-credential rebind (SPEC section 18, EXPERIMENTAL).

THE FAILURE MODE. C2PA and every embedded-credential scheme bind provenance to
the artifact IN BAND: the manifest, the signature, the certificate travel INSIDE
the file. Re-encode the image, screenshot it, copy the bytes out of the
container, or strip the metadata block, and the credential is gone. The artifact
is now "orphaned": naked bytes with no surviving proof of where they came from,
and the embedded-credential verifier can only shrug.

THE EMET ANSWER. EMET never bound to embedded metadata in the first place. Its
anchor is the sha256 of the RAW BYTES (section 3), computed out of band and kept
in a store the artifact does not carry. So a stripped artifact is not orphaned to
EMET at all: re-derive the content hash of the naked bytes and look it up. If a
known anchor records that digest, the artifact REBINDS to it - a fresh MATCH,
established with zero dependence on any credential surviving inside the file.

This is content-addressed rebinding. It does not recover a stripped C2PA manifest
(the embedded bytes are genuinely gone); it makes recovering them UNNECESSARY,
because the binding was to the content, not to the wrapper.

THE HONEST LATTICE (the same closed primary lattice as verify, section 2):

  MATCH        the naked bytes re-derive to a digest a known anchor records.
               The artifact is rebound to that anchor out of band.
  DRIFT        the caller asserts the artifact IS a known identity (--claim), an
               anchor for that identity exists, and the bytes hash DIFFERENTLY.
               A confirmed substitution: right name, wrong bytes.
  UNVERIFIABLE no anchor records these bytes, and no claimed identity resolves to
               a mismatch. The HONEST DEFAULT: an unknown artifact is unknown,
               never trusted. Absence of a rebind is not evidence of forgery, and
               it is never a pass.

UNVERIFIABLE is the default and dominates nothing: DRIFT (a confirmed difference)
outranks it, mirroring the primary precedence (section 5). EMET emits a rebind
FACT only; MATCH here is re-derivation, not trust, approval, or release, and maps
to no authority word (Boundary 1). A rebind can be sealed into a portable witness
receipt (section 17) so the FACT travels where the stripped credential could not.

THE REBIND MANIFEST. The out-of-band anchor a stripped artifact rebinds against
is a portable, content-addressed JSON object: a set of {digest -> identity}
records a verifier already holds or fetches over a trusted channel. It is the
standardized, cross-implementable shape of "the anchors I know", distinct from the
implementation-private anchor store (section 15) which cannot travel. Its own
`manifest_id` content-addresses its records so a doctored manifest is detectable
before any rebind is attempted.

This module is stdlib-only and part of the named core (section 10). It reuses the
existing spine: hashlib for the content address, report.canonical() for the byte
form (section 7), and the closed primary lattice (verdict.py) for every token.

EXPERIMENTAL: the rebind command and the emet-rebind-manifest/v1 shape are marked
experimental in this release. The Python reference ships here with conformance
vectors and tests; cross-language (Rust/Node/Go) parity is SPECced as follow-on
(docs/REBIND-SPEC.md) and NOT yet pinned in conformance/vectors.json as a
required capability.
