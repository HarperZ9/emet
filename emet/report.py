"""report.py - EMET output rendering: the human grammar (default) and the
machine-readable --json envelope (SPEC section 13, the v1 target).

Part of the named core (SPEC section 10); stdlib-only, no third-party
dependency. It changes only HOW a verdict is rendered, never WHAT: the verdict
token still comes through verdict.governed() at the call site, so the closed
lattice (SPEC section 2) is enforced before a byte reaches stdout in either mode.

The envelope is canonical JSON - sorted keys, ", "/": " separators, UTF-8,
ensure_ascii - the SAME byte form SPEC section 7 pins for the audit chain. That
makes the governed fields of an envelope re-derivable and byte-identical across
conforming implementations; impl-defined detail (verify want/got, corroborate
per-channel hashes - SPEC sections 4 and 15) may differ or be absent.
