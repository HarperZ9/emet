"""witness_receipt.py - SPEC section 17: the portable, offline-verifiable
witness receipt (named core).

A witness receipt is a self-contained JSON object that encodes one or more EMET
verdicts plus the METHOD (hash algorithm, spec version, corpus version if the
producing command pinned one) so a DIFFERENT party can statelessly re-derive and
check it on their OWN machine with ZERO shared state, zero trust in the producer,
and zero network access. Today the anchor store (SPEC section 15) is
implementation-private, so a verdict cannot leave the machine that made it; the
receipt is the standardized, cross-implementable form that CAN travel.

Two independent integrity checks compose here, and neither is a trust decision:

  1. content-addressing (default): receipt_id = sha256(canonical(receipt minus
     receipt_id and signature)). Tampering ANY governed field re-hashes to a
     different id, so a doctored receipt is detectable with no shared secret.
  2. subject re-derivation (optional): given the subject files on disk, re-hash
     their bytes and compare against the recorded digests. This proves the
     receipt is a POINT-IN-TIME snapshot, not a blanket certificate: when the
     subject changes, re-derivation diverges.

A signature (HMAC-SHA256 over the canonical body) is OPTIONAL and out-of-spec: it
adds integrity assurance only when producer and verifier already share a key
channel. With no key the signature field is null and content-addressing stands
alone. EMET emits witness FACTS only: the receipt-level verdict lives in the
closed RECEIPT lattice (verdict.py) and maps to no authority word.

This module is stdlib-only and part of the named core (SPEC section 10). It reuses
the existing spine: report.canonical() for the byte-identical JSON form (SPEC
section 7), report.self_hash() for the implementation identity (SPEC section 14),
and the closed verdict lattice (verdict.py) for every governed token it emits.
