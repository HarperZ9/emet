organs.py - perception + impedance for the coherence membrane.

The membrane has eyes and a reflex, never hands. organs.py adds two organs and
no third:
  PERCEPTION - witness artifacts across space (paths) and time (since-anchor):
    watch    <manifest> <path>...   open eyes: anchor + logical stamp
    observe  <manifest> <path>...   report UNCHANGED / DRIFTED / NEW / GONE
    confirm  <manifest> <path>...   witness what an operator action changed
  IMPEDANCE - report the re-derivable FACT of whether a proposed OPERATOR action
    has a clean VCS revert path BEFORE it lands; emit REVERTIBLE / NOT_REVERTIBLE
    plus the revert recipe. This is a FACT (a clean revert path exists), NEVER a
    permission to act. Performs nothing; grants nothing.
    gate     <path>...              pre-action check (clean VCS revert path?)

Invariants (the membrane, unchanged):
  * actuates ZERO. The single actuator is the operator. organs only witness and
    advise. gate never edits, never backs up, never reverts - it reports the
    FACT that the operator already HAS a clean revert path (committed VCS state)
    and records the pre-state hash. The operator VCS is the reversibility; organs
    only report whether it exists. REVERTIBLE is a re-derivable fact, not a
    permission; organs grant nobody the authority to act. Many eyes, one hand,
    the hand is the operator.
  * facts and advice only. Every line is re-derivable; decides no safety question.
