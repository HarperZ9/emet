"""verdict.py - the closed verdict lattice, made STRUCTURAL (Boundary 1).

SPEC sections 2 and 6 declare the verdict lattice CLOSED: every integrity
judgement EMET emits MUST be a member of a fixed, enumerated set, and no
codepath may emit TRUSTED, APPROVED, SAFE, or any value asserting authority.

Before this module the closure was enforced by REVIEW: the tokens were bare
string literals scattered through membrane.py and monitor.py, so emitting an
unsanctioned verdict (e.g. TRUSTED) would have been a review miss, not a
construction error. This module makes the closure STRUCTURAL: every governed
verdict is emitted through governed(), which asserts the token belongs to the
allowed set for its channel and RAISES on a violation. An unsanctioned verdict
therefore fails at construction time, inside the named-core TCB, before a byte
reaches stdout.

This module is part of the named core (SPEC section 10) and depends only on the
language and standard library - in fact on no imports at all. It changes only
HOW a token is emitted, never WHAT: governed() returns the token VERBATIM, so
the surrounding text, spacing, and order at each call site - and thus every
stdout byte - are unchanged. The frozensets below ENUMERATE the governed set;
they do not rename, reorder, or reformat any existing token.

The sets are per CHANNEL because the lattice is layered (SPEC section 2): the
primary integrity lattice is distinct from the closed auxiliary judgements
(coherence, corroboration) and from the governed monitor/audit tokens. None of
these is, or maps to, TRUSTED.

AUDIT = frozenset({"INTACT", "BROKEN"})

# --- Portable witness receipt result (SPEC section 17). The stateless offline
# verifier (`emet check`) re-derives a receipt's content address and, optionally,
# its subject digests, and emits exactly one of these. RECEIPT_VALID is a FACT of
# re-derivation (the recorded bytes still hash to the recorded digests, and the
# receipt's own content address is intact), NOT a trust or release decision - it
# maps to no authority word. RECEIPT_TAMPERED is a confirmed divergence (a
# doctored field or a changed subject); RECEIPT_UNVERIFIABLE is an inability to
# check (malformed receipt, missing subject). Like the primary lattice, absence of
# TAMPERED is VALID or UNVERIFIABLE - never trust.

# auxiliary judgements, it does not rename them. (Cross-language conformance

# --- Governed organs judgements (SPEC section 2: organs auxiliary judgements).
# organs.py perception emits per-path UNCHANGED / DRIFTED / NEW / GONE; organs.py
# impedance (gate) emits REVERTIBLE / NOT_REVERTIBLE, the re-derivable FACT that a
# clean operator VCS revert path exists - explicitly NOT a permission to act, and
# mapping to no authority word. These are the exact tokens organs.py ships; this
# change ENUMERATES them as governed auxiliary judgements, it does not rename them.
