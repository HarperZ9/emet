monitor.py - external accountability monitor for the coherence membrane.

Watches a target (a set of files or a baseline manifest) from OUTSIDE, by re-derivation. Trusts
nothing; reports to the operator; decides nothing.

  report   <manifest>   verify every anchored file vs baseline + marker census;
                        DRIFT = change since the operator last authorized.
  reanchor <manifest>   operator authorizes the CURRENT state as the new baseline
                        (re-hash the manifest path set); logged, so every baseline
                        change is itself accounted for.

Baseline policy: the manifest is the operator-signed authorized state. Drift =
unauthorized change. After an authorized change, the operator reanchors; that
event is logged. Every change to the target is therefore either operator-anchored
or flagged - the account stays legible.

Log: monitor_log.jsonl, hash-chained (the accountability history is tamper-evident).
Facts and advice only. Reads raw bytes. Never edits the target.
