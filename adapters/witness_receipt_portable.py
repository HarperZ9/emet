witness_receipt_portable.py - offline re-verifier for the portable witness
receipt (SPEC section 17).

Optional, out-of-core, stdlib-only convenience wrapper. It provides
`emet check <receipt.json>` in one place for a party who received a receipt and
wants to re-derive it on a completely isolated machine: no anchor store, no
membrane_log.jsonl, no network, no shared key required. It does NOT change the
receipt structure or the closed verdict lattice - it calls the same named-core
re-derivation (emet.witness_receipt.check_receipt) the CLI `emet check` uses.

Usage:
  python witness_receipt_portable.py <receipt.json> [--recompute-from-paths]
  python witness_receipt_portable.py <receipt.json> --recompute-from-paths <dir>

Verdict + exit code (mirrors the core lattice precedence):
  RECEIPT_VALID        exit 0   content address re-derives; subjects (if asked)
                                still hash to the recorded digests.
  RECEIPT_TAMPERED     exit 1   a doctored field or a changed subject.
  RECEIPT_UNVERIFIABLE exit 2   malformed receipt or an unreadable subject.
